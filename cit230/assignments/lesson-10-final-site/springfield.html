            <h3>Franklin Breaks Record</h3>

                    <img src="images/beach.jpg" alt="Beach">
                It seems as if dogs and the beach should go hand in hand: There’s so much to smell and roll around in and so much space for running, swimming and playing catch. (You could say the same of people.) And when it comes to precious beach time, it’s usually the people and their rules that take priority over what dogs and their loyal owners would prefer.
                That said, dog-friendly beach options seem to be on the rise. Many New Jersey and New York beach towns are turning over blocks of beaches to dogs, or at least creating dog-friendly beach hours. More hotels, motels and vacation rentals are allowing beachgoers to bring their pets, too.
